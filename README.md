Combining AI and Human Intuition: The Future of Algorithmic Trading

Artificial intelligence and machine learning have revolutionized the world of algorithmic trading, but they are not without limitations. The results of a new study by Gregory Roy, an AI research scientist, suggest that when it comes to trading, a combination of human intuition and AI algorithms may be the best approach.

Roy's research paper, "Multi-Timeframe Algorithmic Trading Bots using Thick Data Heuristics with Deep Reinforcement Learning," examines the use of thick data heuristics (TDH) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in algorithmic trading. The author argues that traditional DRL agents, while capable of playing games like chess and Go, lack the human intuition that is critical in financial markets.
<br>
To address this, Roy proposes combining human intuition with DRL techniques to create a TDH-DQN augmented AI trading bot. This bot learns through test data to predict the optimal timing of order executions autonomously, but still requires human intervention in defining objectives and curating data.
<br>
The results of the study showed that the TDH-DQN augmented AI trading bot outperformed benchmark algorithmic trading approaches, with a focus on Nasdaq and NYSE stocks with strong catalysts. However, Roy stresses the importance of human oversight, as the competitive nature of trading requires monitoring and maintenance to ensure the model stays up-to-date.
<br>
In conclusion, while AI and machine learning have changed the landscape of algorithmic trading, they still require human expertise to be successful. The future of algorithmic trading may lie in combining the strengths of both human intuition and AI algorithms.
